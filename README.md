# Restaurant Organiser

## Idea
My goal was to create an application that will help in collecting orders in a restaurant. A person who collects orders can simply choose meals and quantity from the list.
Then all of the orders can be seen and marked as done  by the staff in the kitchen. My web-application also allow to edit the menu (add new dishes, delete ones and change some information) and send a daily report via restaurant's email.

## Access
